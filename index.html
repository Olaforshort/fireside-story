    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...
      <br>
      When a earthquake shook the entire east coast of the United States.
      <br>
      The ground shook viciously, sirens blared from every device in the house, then suddenly every thing went still.
      <br>
      The stillness lasted but a moment as every branch of law enforcement sprung into action, 
      but only two brave souls could possibly get to the bottom of this phenomema: Special Agents Ola & Lily.
      <br> 
      But where could they be found?
